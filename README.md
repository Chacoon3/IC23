# IC23

- This repo contains all the data, code, and deliverables for the 2023 UMD Info Challange. 
- In this project, I and my teammates worked together to present data analysis and visualization for the Washington Coded Fatal Crash (CFC) dataset. We also referenced some third-party dataset to support our conclusions and to refine our logic. 
- The project was required to be completed within one week so there are still rooms for improvement.

### Introduction to the subfolders:
